    "This document primarily focuses on accessing the Twitter API, the privileges we have to work with, extended privileges for when we are ready to move forward with our analysis, how we can query Twitter searches, and identifying the features we have to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agenda\n",
    "- Identifying the privileges we have to work with and extended privileges\n",
    "- Accessing the twitter API with Python.\n",
    "- Identifying the features/variables available through the Twitter API, and defining them.\n",
    "- Practice filtering for specific hashtags, such as \"#ChineseVirus\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Twitter API\n",
    "Refer to the [Getting Started](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/platform-overview) page on the Twitter Developer Platform site so sign up for the twitter API. This shit be smooth sailing. There are three products we can access through the Twitter API. We now have access to the Elevated product.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Essential\n",
    "Free and immediate access to the Twitter API. No application is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 environment per project (irrelevant)\n",
    "- 500K tweets per month/project\n",
    "- Cost: free\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Elevated\n",
    "Higher levels of access to the Twitter API for free with an approved application.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3 environments per project (irrelevant)\n",
    "- 2M tweets per month/project\n",
    "- Cost: free\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Academic Research\n",
    "For academics who have a research project that requires, or would benefit from, studying Twitter’s conversational data. Access is free. An application is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 environments per project (irrelevant)\n",

    "- Cost: free\n",

    "### Search Tweets\n",
    "\n",
    "We will primarily be utilizing the [Search Tweets](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/introduction) features. \n",
    "\n",
    "Searching for Tweets is an important feature used to surface Twitter conversations about a specific topic or event. While this functionality is present in Twitter, these endpoints provide greater flexibility and power when filtering for and ingesting Tweets so you can find relevant data for your research more easily; build out near-real-time ‘listening’ applications; or generally explore, analyze, and/or act upon Tweets related to a topic of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "Twitter offers two endpoints that allow you to search for Tweets: Recent search and full-archive search. Both of these REST endpoints share a common design and features, including their use of a single search query to filter for Tweets around a specific topic. These search queries are created with a set of operators that match on Tweet and user attributes, such as message keywords, hashtags, and URLs. Operators can be combined into queries with boolean logic and parentheses to help refine the queries matching behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you’ve set up your query and start receiving Tweets, these endpoints support navigating the results both by time and Tweet ID ranges. This is designed to support two common use cases: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Get historical**: Requests are for a period of interest, with no focus on the real-time nature of the data. A single request is made, and all matching data is delivered using pagination as needed. This is the default mode for Search Tweets.\n",
    "- **Polling or listening**: Requests are made in a \"any new Tweets since my last request?\" mode. Requests are made on a continual basis, and typically there is a use case focused on near real-time 'listening' for Tweets of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many operators and query limits are exclusive to Academic Research access, meaning that you must use keys and tokens from an App within a Project with Academic Research access to utilize the additional functionality. You can learn more about this in the endpoint sections below. Both the recent search and the full-archive search endpoints returned Tweets contribute to the monthly Tweet cap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's go over the two endpoints provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recent search\n",
    "The recent search endpoint allows you to programmatically access filtered public Tweets posted over the last week, and is available to all developers who have a developer account and are using keys and tokens from an App within a Project.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can authenticate your requests with OAuth 1.0a User Context, OAuth 2.0 App-Only, or OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE. However, if you would like to receive private metrics, or a breakdown of organic and promoted metrics within your Tweet results, you will have to use OAuth 1.0a User Context or OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE, and pass user Access Tokens that are associated with the user that published the given content. \n",
    "\n",
    "This endpoint can deliver up to 100 Tweets per request in reverse-chronological order, and pagination tokens are provided for paging through large sets of matching Tweets. \n",
    "\n",
    "When using a Project with Essential or Elevated access, you can use the basic set of operators and can make queries up to 512 characters long. When using a Project with Academic Research access, you have access to additional operators and can make queries up to 1024 characters long. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Full-archive search\n",
    "*Academic Research access only*\n",
    "\n",
    "The v2 full-archive search endpoint is only available to Projects with Academic Research access. The endpoint allows you to programmatically access public Tweets from the complete archive dating back to the first Tweet in March 2006, based on your search query.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can authenticate your requests to this endpoint using OAuth 2.0 App-Only, and the App Access Token must come from an App that is within a Project that has Academic Research access. Since you cannot make a request on behalf of other users (OAuth 1.0a User Context or OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE) with this endpoint, you will not be able to pull private metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "This endpoint can deliver up to 500 Tweets per request in reverse-chronological order, and pagination tokens are provided for paging through large sets of matching Tweets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since this endpoint is only available to those that have been approved for Academic Research access, you have access to the full set of search operators and can make queries up to 1024 characters long.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing the Twitter API with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get our hands dirty with some code. I have applied to a Twitter Developer Account and I have my API key and API key secret stored in a seperate document, I will import it below. But first, lets introduce [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/). Tweepy is an easy-to-use Python library for accessing the Twitter API. Let's pip install it so it is accessible in our environment. Note that you only have to pip install tweepy (or any library) once, but you will have to import it in every instance you need it."

    "1. Temporal Trends: what time frame are we looking at? The research publication gathered tweets one week before, and one week after Trump made his first tweet referring to Covid-19 as the \"Chinese Virus\".\n",
    "2. To build on point 1, if we want to access tweets archived prior to one week ago, we will need to apply for the Academic Research product. The product is free, and will grant us greater flexibility with our work. Of course, I plan to use this privilege reasonably, and make only small requests until we've further developed our project.\n",
    "3. What notable sentiments are we targetting in the tweets? It is one thing to gather all tweets with the hashtag \"#chinesevirus\" or \"#covid19\". The article provided considers a tweet anti-Asian if one of the four conditions were met,\n",
    "- 1. Was opposed to or hostile toward the region, the people, or culture of Asia;\n",
    "- 2. Demonstrated a general fear, mistrust, and hatred of Asian ethnic groups;\n",
    "- 3. Supported restrictions on Asian immigration\n",
    "- 4. Used derogatory language or condoned punishments toward Asian countries or their people\n",

    "Continuing on point 3, what sentiments are we targeting? From there we can establish methods to extract those sentiments from the tweets and filter for/against them.\n",

    "4. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing technique in Python. We can grade the sentiment of a string of text on a scale of [-1, 1], -1 indicating a negative sentiment, and 1 indicating a positive sentiment, while 0 indicated neutrality. Let's keep this in mind moving forward."
